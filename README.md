## üìå **Project Overview**

The **RedBag API** is a project developed at **Fatec Registro**, designed to provide a fast and accurate diagnosis for **dogs with cataracts**. Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, this API implements a predictive model capable of classifying animals as **healthy or affected by cataracts** efficiently.

This **Python-based API** works in conjunction with the **RedBag API (Java)**, which serves as a **Backend for Frontend (BFF)** to handle interactions between the front-end and backend services.

üëâ Access the [RedBag API (Java)](https://github.com/MateusOK/Redbag.git) for more details.

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Cloudinary Account](https://cloudinary.com/)
- [RedBag API (Java)](https://github.com/MateusOK/Redbag.git) (must be running for full functionality)

### **Cloning the Repository**

Clone this project to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MateusOK/RedBag-Python-API.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd RedBag-Python-API
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Environment Variables**

Set up a `.env` file with your Cloudinary credentials:

```yaml
CLOUD_NAME={YOUR_CLOUD_NAME}
API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}
API_SECRET={YOUR_API_SECRET}
```

### **Starting the API**

Run the application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Ensure the **Java API** is running for full system functionality.

  "confidence": 0.89
}
```

#### **GET /health**

_Response:_
```json
{
  "status": "alive"
}
```
